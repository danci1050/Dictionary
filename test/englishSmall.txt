How nice to finally write to you again. I have not seen you in a long time. I now live in Amsterdam. I
live in a small house with my girlfriend. There is a football field next to my house. There I play football
every Saturday together with a few friends. I made new friends at the football club.
They are called Aman and Jan. Jan is eighteen years old and also lives in Amsterdam. Aman is the older brother of
Jan.
